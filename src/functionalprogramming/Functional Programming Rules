Pure Functional Programming Rules:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. There should be no state around your functions.

2. Functions should have to be pure functions; shouldn't depend on any state:
(global variables or methods).

3. Functions should have no side affects.

4. They are higher-order functions if:
    a. Takes one or more functions as parameters;
    b. or the functions returns another functions as a result.
