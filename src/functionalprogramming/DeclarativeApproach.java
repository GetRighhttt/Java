        DeclarativeApproach or in other words, functional programming is essentially
        just using streams with collections in Java.

        streams() allows us to go into an abstract mode where we simply tell
        it what we want.

        so basically, if we wanted to do have the same output as we have for the
        imperative approach, all we have to do is create a stream.

        person.stream().filter(person -> FEMALE.equals(person.gender))
        .foreach(System.out::println)
         */

    }
}
